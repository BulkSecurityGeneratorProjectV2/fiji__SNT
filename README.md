This repository has been archived. It hosts the code for the now deprecated *Simple Neurite Tracer* plugin for the Fiji distribution of ImageJ. Its development has migrated to [morphonets/SNT](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT) where the program has been re-written, modernized, and extended to become a complete neuroanatomy toolbox for the ImageJ ecosystem.
