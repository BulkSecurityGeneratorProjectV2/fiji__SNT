This repository hosts the code for the now deprecated *Simple Neurite Tracer* plugin for the Fiji distribution of ImageJ. Released in [2010-2011](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btr390), *Simple Neurite Tracer* remains the single most cited open-source software for semi-automated 3D reconstructions.  Its development has migrated to [morphonets/SNT](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT) where it has been re-written, modernized, and extended to become a full neuroanatomy toolbox for the ImageJ ecosystem.
